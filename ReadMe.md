Welcome to HomeMade Chat style version!
HomeMade is a food delivery app but with a twist. The idea is that instead of ordering form Restaurants, users who want more variety and local flavors can place orders to local HomeMade chefs. "Chefs" will use the app to post what they are cooking up for the day and when the meals will be available (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner). Then Users will be able to, in real time, see available meals, reserve a meal and purchase a meal for later.

The App
This is still a work in progress. I will be using React on the front end and nodeJS with Graphql/Apollo on the back end to send user queries and mutations.

This is a variation on HomeMade I wanted to explore the idea of making the app more of a chat style app where users would post a meal they just made and it would update live on a dashboard for current user that are looking for a meal.

For now I am writing my own Auth to get a feel for the process, but will likely move the auth to AWS or FireBase.

I want to have fun on the front end and plan on using Framer Motion to do some animations.

I am thinking that image storage will be done either Cloudinary or a Google FireBase product, TBD.

For now this is a Web app but would obviously benefit from a mobile version so the plan is to later migrate to mobile using Flutter.

File notes
There are some challenges as the documentation for Hooks/Graphql/Auth is not exactly well defined. I may end up doing a re-write but for now I am trying to figure it all out as I go.

More to come!!....
